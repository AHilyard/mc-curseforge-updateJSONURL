# CurseForge update checker (for updateJSONURL)

This project aims at making forge's `updateJSONURL` as easy as possible.

It is a web API that will return `updateJSONURL` compatible JSON files for your mod, using CurseForge as the source
to determine available versions.

The endpoint is simply `<host>/<modId>`, eg. `http://localhost:3000/284745`
